## 🧠 What I learned

- Managing component state with useState
- Navigating an array of objects and dynamically updating the view
- Using useEffect (commented out in this version) for auto-play functionality
- Handling conditional logic inside a setState function
- Creating a reusable and encapsulated slider component
